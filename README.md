# ToyRendererDX11
 Renderer on DirectX 11 writing for learning purposes. However this is a **toy** renderer so there are a lot of shitty and unreadable code.  
 ### Inspiration and using
 * [Vortice.Windows](https://github.com/amerkoleci/Vortice.Windows)
 * [alimer](https://github.com/amerkoleci/alimer)
 And in the end I wanna give big respect to [Amer Koleci](https://github.com/amerkoleci) for his work.
